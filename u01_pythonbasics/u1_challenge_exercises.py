# Part 3: Challenge Exercises

# Exercise 1
# Write a program to calculate the perimeter of a rectangle.
# Example: Assign 12 to length and 8 to width.
# Calculate the perimeter using the formula: 2 * (length + width).

"""
length = 12
breadth = 8
perimeter = 2 * (length + breadth)

#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2
# Use variables to create a descriptive sentence.
# Example: Assign "Alice" to name and "reading" to hobby.
# Combine them to display: "Alice loves reading in her free time."
# You must have 2 variables to complete this exercise

"""
name = "Alice"
hobby = "reading"
sentence = name + " loves " + hobby + " in her free time."

#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3
# Combine repetition and a meaningful statement.
# Example: Print "Let's go! " three times, followed by "We can do it!"
# Example Output: Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! We can do it!
# You have to use the string * x method to duplicate the words to complete this exercise.

"""

#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 4
# Write a program to manually display a triangle of stars using the print statement.
# You must use the "string" * x, where x is a number to multiply your strings.
# Example Output:
# *
# **
# ***
# ****
# *****

# Exercise 5
# Write a program to display a centered triangle of stars with 5 rows
# # Example Output:
#     *    
#    ***  
#   *****
#  *******
# *********
# Hint: Use spaces and stars with string concatenation (+).
