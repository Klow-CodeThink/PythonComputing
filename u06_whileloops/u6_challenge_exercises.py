# Part 3: Challenge Exercises

# Write a program to calculate the sum of digits of a given
# number using a while loop. 
# Example:
# Input = 1234
# Output = 10

"""
num = int(input("Enter a number: "))        # Input number

total = 0                   # Initialize total sum

while num > 0:              # Use while loop to extract and sum each digit
    digit = num % 10        # Get the last digit
    total += digit          # Add the digit to the total (total = total + digit)
    num = num // 10         # Remove the last digit

print("The sum of the digits is:", total)   # Print the result
"""

#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 2
# # Write a program to calculate the factorial of a number using
# a while loop.
# Example:
# Input = 5
# Output = 120.





#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 3
# # The Collatz sequence is defined as follows:
# Start with a positive integer.
# If the number is even, divide it by 2.
# If the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
# Repeat this process until the number becomes 1.
# Example: 
# Input = 6
# Output = 6, 3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
# More info on the Collatz
# The Collatz Conjecture, also known as the "3n + 1" sequence,
# proposes that starting with any positive number and applying
# two rules (if even, divide by two; if odd, triple it and add one)
# will always eventually lead to the number one.
