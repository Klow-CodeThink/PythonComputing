# one for students enrolled in a club and another for students who paid membership fees.
 
# Identify students who are both enrolled and have paid.

# Example:
# Input:
# club_members = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"]
# paid_members = ["Charlie", "David", "Eve"]

# Exercise 3: Reversing Letters of Each Word
# Scenario: A text-based encryption system reverses the letters of 
# each word in a sentence to obscure its meaning.
 
# Write a program to simulate this.

# Example:
# Input: "Python is fun"
# Output: "nohtyP si nuf"

# Input: "Hello world"
# Output: "olleH dlrow"







#------------------------------------------------------------
# Exercise 4: Extracting Even-Indexed Elements
# Scenario:
# A temperature monitoring device records hourly temperatures over a day.
# Extract data for even hours (0, 2, 4, etc.) for analysis.

# Example:
# Input: hourly_temperatures = [22, 23, 21, 24, 20, 25, 19, 26]
# Output: [22, 21, 20, 19]

# Input: hourly_temperatures = [30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]
# Output: [30, 32, 34]
